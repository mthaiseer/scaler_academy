Reverse Link List II
Problem Description

Reverse a linked list A from position B to C.

NOTE: Do it in-place and in one-pass.



Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 106

1 <= B <= C <= |A|



Input Format
The first argument contains a pointer to the head of the given linked list, A.

The second arugment contains an integer, B.

The third argument contains an integer C.



Output Format
Return a pointer to the head of the modified linked list.



Example Input
Input 1:

A = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
B = 2
C = 4

Input 2:

A = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
B = 1
C = 5


Example Output
Output 1:

1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5
Output 2:

5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

In the first example, we want to reverse the highlighted part of the given linked list : 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Thus, the output is 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5
Explanation 2:

In the second example, we want to reverse the highlighted part of the given linked list : 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5  
Thus, the output is 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
