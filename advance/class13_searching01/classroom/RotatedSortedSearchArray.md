Rotated Sorted Array Search
Problem Description

Given a sorted array of integers A of size N and an integer B.

array A is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 ).

You are given a target value B to search. If found in the array, return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

NOTE: Users are expected to solve this in O(log(N)) time.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000000

1 <= A[i] <= 10^9

all elements in A are disitinct.



Input Format
The first argument given is the integer array A.

The second argument given is the integer B.



Output Format
Return index of B in array A, otherwise return -1



Example Input
Input 1:

A = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3]
B = 4
Input 2:

A = [1]
B = 1


Example Output
Output 1:

0
Output 2:

0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:


Target 4 is found at index 0 in A.
Explanation 2:


Target 1 is found at index 0 in A.
