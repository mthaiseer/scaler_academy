Problem Description

Given an array of words A (dictionary) and another array B (which contain some words).

You have to return the binary array (of length |B|) as the answer where 1 denotes that the word is present in the dictionary and 0 denotes it is not present.

Formally, for each word in B, you need to return 1 if it is present in Dictionary and 0 if it is not.

Such problems can be seen in real life when we work on any online editor (like Google Documnet), if the word is not valid it is underlined by a red line.

NOTE: Try to do this in O(n) time complexity.
