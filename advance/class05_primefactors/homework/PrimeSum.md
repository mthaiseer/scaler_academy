Prime Sum
Problem Description

Given an even number A ( greater than 2 ), return two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to given number.

If there are more than one solutions possible, return the lexicographically smaller solution.

If [a, b] is one solution with a <= b, and [c,d] is another solution with c <= d, then 
[a, b] < [c, d], If a < c OR a==c AND b < d. 
NOTE: A solution will always exist. Read Goldbach's conjecture.



Problem Constraints
4 <= A <= 2*107



Input Format
First and only argument of input is an even number A.



Output Format
Return a integer array of size 2 containing primes whose sum will be equal to given number.



Example Input
 4


Example Output
 [2, 2]


Example Explanation
 There is only 1 solution for A = 4.
