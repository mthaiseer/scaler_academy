Least Common Ancestor
Problem Description

Find the lowest common ancestor in an unordered binary tree A given two values B and C in the tree.

Lowest common ancestor : the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes and w in a tree or directed acyclic graph (DAG) is the lowest (i.e. deepest) node that has both v and w as descendants.



Problem Constraints
1 <= size of tree <= 100000

1 <= B, C <= 109



Input Format
First argument is head of tree A.

Second argument is integer B.

Third argument is integer C.



Output Format
Return the LCA.



Example Input
Input 1:


      1
     /  \
    2    3
B = 2
C = 3
Input 2:

      1
     /  \
    2    3
/ \
4   5
B = 4
C = 5


Example Output
Output 1:

1
Output 2:

2


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

LCA is 1.
Explanation 2:
