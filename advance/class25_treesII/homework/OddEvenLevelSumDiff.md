Odd and Even Levels
Problem Description

Given a binary tree of integers. Find the difference between the sum of nodes at odd level and sum of nodes at even level.

NOTE: Consider the level of root node as 1.



Problem Constraints
1 <= Number of nodes in binary tree <= 100000

0 <= node values <= 109



Input Format
First and only argument is a root node of the binary tree, A



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the difference between the sum of nodes at odd level and sum of nodes at even level.



Example Input
Input 1:

        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
4   5 6   7
/
8
Input 2:

        1
       / \
      2   10
       \
        4


Example Output
Output 1:

10
Output 2:

-7


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

Sum of nodes at odd level = 23
Sum of ndoes at even level = 13
Explanation 2:

Sum of nodes at odd level = 5
Sum of ndoes at even level = 12
