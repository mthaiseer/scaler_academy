Palindrome List
Problem Description

Given a singly linked list A, determine if its a palindrome. Return 1 or 0 denoting if its a palindrome or not, respectively.



Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 105



Input Format
The first and the only argument of input contains a pointer to the head of the given linked list.



Output Format
Return 0, if the linked list is not a palindrome.

Return 1, if the linked list is a palindrome.



Example Input
Input 1:

A = [1, 2, 2, 1]
Input 2:

A = [1, 3, 2]


Example Output
Output 1:

1
Output 2:

0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

The first linked list is a palindrome as [1, 2, 2, 1] is equal to its reversed form.
Explanation 2:

The second linked list is not a palindrom as [1, 3, 2] is not equal to [2, 3, 1].
