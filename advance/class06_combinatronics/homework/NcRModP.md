Compute nCr % p
Problem Description

Given three integers A, B and C, where A represents n, B represents r and C represents p and p is a prime number greater than equal to n, find and return the value of nCr % p where nCr % p = (n! / ((n-r)! * r!)) % p.

x! means factorial of x i.e. x! = 1 * 2 * 3... * x.

NOTE: For this problem, we are considering 1 as a prime.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 106
1 <= B <= A
A <= C <= 109+7


Input Format
The first argument given is the integer A ( = n).
The second argument given is the integer B ( = r).
The third argument given is the integer C ( = p).



Output Format
Return the value of nCr % p.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = 5
 B = 2
 C = 13
Input 2:

 A = 6
 B = 2
 C = 13


Example Output
Output 1:

 10
Output 2:

 2


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 nCr( n=5 and r=2) = 10.
 p=13. Therefore, nCr%p = 10.
