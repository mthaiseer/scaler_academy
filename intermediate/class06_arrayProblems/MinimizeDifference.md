Minimize Difference
Problem Description

Given an array of integers A of size, N. Minimize the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum element of the array.

You can perform two types of operations at most B times in total to change the values in the array.
Multiple operations can be performed on the same element.

Increment : A[i] -> A[i] + 1.

Decrement : A[i] -> A[i] - 1.

Return the minimum difference possible.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105

1 <= A[i] <= 106

1 <= B <= 109



Input Format
First argument is an integer array A.
Second argument is an integer B which represents the maximum number of operations that can be performed.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the minimum difference.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [2, 6, 3, 9, 8]
 B = 3
Input 2:

 A = [4, 6, 3, 1, 4]
 B = 5


Example Output
Output 1:

 5
Output 2:

 1


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 We can apply the atmost 3 operations in the following sequence.
 Initial array => [2, 6, 3, 9, 8].
   Decrement 9 => [2, 6, 3, 8, 8].
   Increment 2 => [3, 6, 3, 8, 8].
   Increment 3 => [3, 6, 4, 8, 8].
 Max = 8. Min = 3.
 Therefore, abs|Max - Min| = |8 - 3| = 5.
Explanation 2:

 We can apply the atmost 5 operations in the following sequence.
 Initial array => [4, 6, 3, 1, 4].
   Increment 1 => [4, 6, 3, 2, 4].
   Decrement 6 => [4, 5, 3, 2, 4].
   Increment 2 => [4, 5, 3, 3, 4].
   Decrement 5 => [4, 4, 3, 3, 4].
   Increment 3 => [4, 4, 4, 3, 4].
 Max = 4. Min = 3.
 Therefore, abs|Max - Min| = |4 - 3| = 1.
