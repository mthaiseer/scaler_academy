Grid Unique Paths
Problem Description

A robot is located at the top-left corner of an A x B grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).



The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?



Problem Constraints
A and B will be such that the resulting answer fits in a 32 bit signed integer.



Input Format
First argument of input will be single integer A.
Second argument of input will be single integer B.



Output Format
Return a single integer denoting the number of unique paths.



Example Input
 A = 2, B = 2


Example Output
 2


Example Explanation
 2 possible routes : (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1) 
              OR  : (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1)
