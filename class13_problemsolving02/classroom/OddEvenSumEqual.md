Count ways to make sum of odd and even indexed elements equal by removing an array element
Problem Description

Given an array, arr[] of size N, the task is to find the count of array indices such that removing an element from these indices makes the sum of even-indexed and odd-indexed array elements equal.



Problem Constraints
1<=n<=1e5
-1e5<=A[i]<=1e5


Input Format
First argument contains an array A of integers of size N


Output Format
Return the count of array indices such that removing an element from these indices makes the sum of even-indexed and odd-indexed array elements equal.



Example Input
Input 1:
A=[2, 1, 6, 4]
Input 2:

A=[1, 1, 1]


Example Output
Output 1:
1
Output 2:

3


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
Removing arr[1] from the array modifies arr[] to { 2, 6, 4 } such that, arr[0] + arr[2] = arr[1]. 
Therefore, the required output is 1. 
Explanation 2:

 Removing arr[0] from the given array modifies arr[] to { 1, 1 } such that arr[0] = arr[1] 
Removing arr[1] from the given array modifies arr[] to { 1, 1 } such that arr[0] = arr[1] 
Removing arr[2] from the given array modifies arr[] to { 1, 1 } such that arr[0] = arr[1] 
Therefore, the required output is 3.
